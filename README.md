WSPR transmitter suspended from party balloons

This is an attempt by me to make a solar-powered WSPR (weak signal propagation reporter - Joe Taylor/K1JT digital mode, 
truly awesome design work on his part).

I'm turning the design over to TAPR (Tucson Amateur Packet Radio) in the hopes that they can sell it and cover some of 
their operating expenses.
