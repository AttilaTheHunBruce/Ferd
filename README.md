# Ferd
WSPR transmitter suspended from party balloons

This is an attempt by me to make a solar-powered WSPR (weak signal propagation reporter - Joe Taylor/K1JT digital mode, 
truly awesome design work on his part).

I'm turning the design over to TAPR (Tucson Amateur Packet Radio) in the hopes that they can sell it and cover some of 
their operating expenses.

Ferd: My friend Joel/W2BJN came up with the name Magellan as a name for the project. I really like that. However, my 
wife thinks the name is too long. I decided to take Magellan's first name (Ferdinand) and shorten it to Ferd. Not willing
to leave well enough alone, my friend John/N8UR suggested that we could use Ferd as an acronym (FERD?). So, fitting an 
acronym to the name it becomes Flying Electronic Radio Device.

Of course I couldn't leave well enough alone, so I speculated that the preproduction version would be 'preferd', the 
version is in production is 'inferd', if sales go so well that we need to make another production run becomese 'referd', 
and a transgenerded version is 'transferd'. Not to be outdone, my friend Tom/N8ZM said that if sales fell off it
might become 'deferd'.
